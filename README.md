# secretaire
Secrétaire is about building a screenless office. A screenless office helps our brain to interact with infomration attentively. That is necessary because our biological computer, our brain, is not able to process lots of information quickly. It's also completely incompatible with multitasking.

The tech sector ignores the need for rest of our primitive brain. The tech sector is so focused on our attention as a source of profit that it deforms our culture. We live with a telecom idiom of ever more concurrent interruptions, ever less adapted to our needs. That deformed idiom is so dominant that even free and open source software projects have started using it subconsciously.

With project secrétaire. we research how this can be done differently. How can we become the customer instead of the product? How do we regain autonomy from a tech sector? We find inspiration in the 1970's.

That's why the screenless office is radically different:
- almost no warnings _about_ information. No to "ping!" for incoming messages!
- limited, high quality information
- respect for your privacy
- customer instead of product
